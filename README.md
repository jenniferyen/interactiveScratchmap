# interactiveScratchmap

I was inspired to create this interactive scratchmap after seeing my friend's real-life scratchmap on which she would mark
off every country that she had travelled to. 

Maps are based off of Mapael, a jQuery plugin (https://www.vincentbroute.fr/mapael/). 
Animations are created with three.js (https://threejs.org/) with inspiration from existing animations (credited in the files).

Dependencies
- "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
- "cookie-session": "^1.3.3",
- "ejs": "^2.6.1",
- "express": "^4.16.4",
- "mongoose": "^5.5.0"

To build after pulling the repo: 
1. Run npm install.
2. Run npm start.
3. An express server should be started at http://localhost:3000 so view the app on there!
